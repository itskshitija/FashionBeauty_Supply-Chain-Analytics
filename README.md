## Summary of Insights 

### ðŸ“ŠDashboard-1: Inventory Management
#### Overall SKU Performance
- The startup offers 100 SKUs, contributing to total revenue of $577,605 with 46,099 products sold.
- The total shipping cost is $554.81, while manufacturing costs amount to $4,727, indicating cost efficiency in production but potentially high logistics expenses

#### Stock Levels & Product Performance
- Skincare products are the top-selling category with 21K units sold, followed by Haircare (14K) and Cosmetics (12K).
- Some SKUs have lower stock availability, which might indicate either high demand or supply chain inefficiencies

#### Shipping & Lead Time Analysis
- There is variability in shipping times by product type, with some products experiencing longer delivery durations.
- Some SKUs with higher stock levels still experience longer shipping times, possibly due to logistical inefficiencies.
- Lead times fluctuate, which may impact the timely stock replenishment.

#### Order & Demand Patterns
- Order quantities by SKU are evenly distributed, but some high-selling products may require better forecasting to prevent stockouts.
- Ensuring top-performing SKUs have optimized inventory levels across all locations can prevent lost sales opportunities.

#### Key Recommendations
- Improve demand forecasting for skincare products to prevent potential stock shortages.
- Optimize logistics & shipping efficiency to reduce lead times and enhance customer satisfaction.
- Analyze supplier performance to minimize fluctuations in stock availability.
- Monitor high shipping cost SKUs and explore alternative carriers or bulk shipping options.
